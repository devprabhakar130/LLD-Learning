// This is just an simple example of Open Close principle,The main aim of open close principle is thta we can ass new functionalities without modifying the code ,we can ensure extensibility ...In this code i just make one abstarct class persitance which has one pure virtual fiunction taht means that class does not knwo how to implement it ,hides that impkementation ,but should eb one behaviour ,i used virtual for runtime poylmorphism so taht obejct function should eb called ,and later i have 3 concrete clasees in which i inherits it from persistance ,by doing this i can ensure extensibiluty without modification..
